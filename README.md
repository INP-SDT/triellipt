A lightweight and flexible finite element solver for elliptic and parabolic PDEs.

- Supports steady-state and transient convectionâ€“diffusion problems.  
- Suitable for standard elliptic equations, such as electrostatics and Helmholtz-type problems.
- Designed with *domain decomposition* and *boundary condition transfer* techniques in mind.

### Pin-to-plane field

This is the standard electrostatic problem for the pin-to-plane configuration, as considered, for example, in [Celestin et al., *J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys.*, 42(6), 065203 (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1088/0022-3727/42/6/065203).

### Ionization wave

This example shows the evolution of an ionization wave in nitrogen, based on the test case from [BessiÃ¨res et al., *J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys.*, 40(21), 6559 (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1088/0022-3727/40/21/016). It illustrates the spatial distribution of the electric field within the wave.

### Mass conservation test

This is an example of a standard mass conservation test used to validate the code.

<img src="./docs/images/amr-meshes.png" width="600">

Two limiting configurations are shown, with the mesh adapted cyclically between them, as demonstrated [here](#adaptive-mesh). A conservative reinterpolation algorithm is used to update the field function defined on the mesh. Details of the algorithm will be provided in a forthcoming paper. The basic features are as follows:

- Algorithm is exact for constant and linear functions.
- Total nodal mass is preserved for any mesh-defined function, up to numerical errorÂ¹.

Â¹ Stays around machine precision for up to a hundred adaptation cycles

### Convergence tests

This is an example of a standard convergence test used to validate the code.

Test features:

- Uses the method of manufactured solutions for verification.
- Applies red-green refinement to a non-conforming mesh.

We consider the Dirichlet problem for the equation

$$
L[u] = \rho
$$

in the domain $[-0.5, 0.5]^2$ with the operator

$$
L = 1 + \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}
$$

and the exact solution 

$$
u = \cos(\pi x) \cos(\pi y)
$$
